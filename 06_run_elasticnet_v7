####Step-by-step guide for new predictDB pipeline v7
*Download PredictDB_Pipeline_GTEx_v7 scripts from lmogil/elasticnet_v7
1. create directory PredictDB_Pipeline_GTEx_v7/prepare_data/
  -make genotype, expression, and covariate directories within prepare_data
  -in the genotype directory 
	  -run split_anot_file_by_chr
      -this splits annotation file by chromosome and MAF >0.01
	  -run split_genotype_by_chr
      -this splits snp file by chromosome and MAF >0.01
	  -check make sure lines are the same in snp and annotation file
    
2.go to PredictDB_Pipeline_GTEx_v7/model_training/scripts/
	-put pop names in mesa_pops2.txt
	-adjust pop_train.R according to file paths and files to be analyzed
	-run train_models_jobs.sh
	**make sure files are formated properly (see step 1)
  
3. run make_dbs.R

4. combine chromosome files and make all_results files
